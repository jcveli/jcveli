          Assignment 2A
      </h1>
    <p>At the moment, I find <strong> cybersecurity</strong> an interesting topic at the moment for me \
        to look into. Even though CSC 152 <strong> (Cryptography) </strong> wasn't exactly the most pleasent 
        experience and was a difficult class, it was still a very interesting topic to learn
        and I am now interested getting into the field of security, particularly in the position
        of a security engineer in the future. 
        The tasks and responsibilities of a security engineer are listed
         <a href="https://www.coursera.org/articles/what-is-a-security-engineer" title="security engineer info">here</a> if you are interested
